**NOTE:** This is a companion to a React Based Web-App currently in development (https://fantastic-naiad-78a9d5.netlify.app/).
This API is built using Node.js, Express and a PostgreSQL Database.
Pokedex API seeks to fufill the functional support of apps that require user authentication to access Pokemons and Types creation functionalities.
The API also accesses information about pokemon like basic stats and description [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/).
Aditionally **_ALL_** endpoints of the API will use ------- as a base url.

<!-- [https://poke-team-node.herokuapp.com/](https://poke-team-node.herokuapp.com/) -->

To access an endpoint simply append an endpoint to the base url.
For instance to access the `/pokemons` endpoint the full url will look like this:

`------`

<!-- `https://poke-team-node.herokuapp.com/teams/all` -->

## User Functionalities

User access and authentication are provisioned through the use of json web tokens (a.k.a. jwt).
Although this api provisions users, some endpoints do not require a user to be logged in.

### Create User Endpoints

**NOTE:** That ":id" refers to a user account's unique identifier in the database.

| HTTP Verb | Endpoint      | Function                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST      | auth/register | Creates a User account based on user input. Also provisions a jwt to user as cookie. |
| POST      | auth/login    | Validates User account then provisions a jwt to a valid, existing user as cookie.    |

#### Register Example

```JSON
// All properties are REQUIRED inputs.
{
  "firstName": "Jose",
  "lastName": "Gavilanes",
  "email": "jose@kmail.com",
  "password": "futur3__k-star",
  "phone": "+521231231231",
  "birthday": "2004/04/30",
}
```

#### Login Example

```JSON
// All properties are REQUIRED inputs.
{
  "email": "jose@kmail.com",
  "password": "futur3__k-star"
}
```

---

### Users Endpoints

**NOTE:** That ":id" refers to a user account's unique identifier in the database.

| HTTP Verb      | Endpoint   | Function                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET            | /users     | Allows user to see all accounts info if logged in.        |
| GET            | /users/:id | Allows user to see an specific account info if logged in. |
| PATCH (ADMIN)  | /users/:id | Allows an admin to update an account info if logged in.   |
| DELETE (ADMIN) | /users/:id | Allows an admin to delete an account if logged in.        |

```JSON
// All properties are REQUIRED inputs.
{
  "firstName": "Jose",
  "lastName": "Gavilanes",
  "email": "jose@kmail.com",
  "password": "futur3__k-star",
  "phone": "+521231231231",
  "birthday": "2004/04/30",
}

```

#### Users/me Endpoints

**NOTE:** That "me" refers to a user account's unique identifier in the database. The user will be able to EDIT and DELETE his/her data, but not the data of another user.

| HTTP Verb | Endpoint  | Function                                                 |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET       | /users/me | Allows user to see his/her account info if logged in.    |
| PATCH     | /users/me | Allows user to update his/her account info if logged in. |
| DELETE    | /users/me | Allows user to delete his/her account if logged in.      |

<!-- | PATCH     | /api/team/:teamId/pokemon | Modifies what pokemon are inside the team.                                    |
